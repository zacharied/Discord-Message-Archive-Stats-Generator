# Discord Chat Dump Stat Generator Thing

For the AVNT boys.

## Usage

Get the dumps of any chat channels you want from [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter). Set it to output as JSON, and place the resulting dumps in the `chats` directory (create it if it doesn't exist already).

Using the `userData.example.jsonc` file as a template, you can create assginments of users to their own home channels in a file called `userData.jsonc`.

To run just `node main.js` should work fine.
